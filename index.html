        <h1>WHO</h1>
        I am Suleiman Abubakar Musa.  A 300L student from Federal University Dutsin-ma Katsina State, studying Computer Science and Information Technology (IT). 
            Now, an undergoing intern at Kaduna ICT Hub.  Despite the fact that, I am still neophyte at learning the backend development but I have been an aspirant 
            of becoming one of the frontend and backend developers long ago.</p>

            <p>To cut long story short, I had developed the idea of becoming both frontend and backend developer since when I was firstly introduced to HTML and CSS coding.
                 I became well impressed with the little I had learnt and put in mind that, I will do the needful until my dream come to reality that, I become a real developer. 
                After I was taught some line of codes (the basic) in the context of HTML in particular; I then kept on practicing the bit I knew about it until when I was able to
                 modify some codes and run/view the output on a certain browser.</p>

            <p>I had once developed a webpage but it did not look awesome the way I normally see other webpage look like in terms of its design; which cannot be compared to the little
                 experience I gain presently. More ever, I used to code almost every blessed day, the more I code in a day, the more I understand many things that I wasnâ€™t really taught. A friend of mine was the one who had actually started shedding more light for me on HTML coding.
                Indeed, it is crystal clear to m that, frontend and backend development is pretty to learn as I had already begun the basics.  Although, I chose it to be my field of specialization so that, there will time in the nearest future which I will be writing a thousand line of codes everyday with impressive products from each raw line of codes.
